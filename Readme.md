StudyAlarm is an Android App which reminds study participants to fill out three types of questionnaire provided by the App. Futhermore it allows the data to be locally exported.

This App is used by the chair for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at Augsburg University in Germany.

The questionnaires are intended to collect data related to stress and mindfulness techniques. The three types of questionnaires are:
* the initial questionnaire for collecting demographic data about the study participant at the beginning of the study,
* the daily questionnaire which should be answered in the morning (9:00) and
* momentary questionnaires which should be filled out at 12, 15, 18 and 21 o'clock.

Next to other questions following standardized questionnaires are included (they might be slightly adapted at some point to fit the study):
